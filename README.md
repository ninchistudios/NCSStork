A very basic mod that ~does~ will do two things:
* displays a count of your children in the bottom right map bar so you can be a proud parent
* provides a baby vending machine if for reasons your spouse (or self) are not getting pregnant or delivering babies

Essentially I had the second problem and rather than wait for a patch, decided to nuke it from orbit by learning how to do Bannerlord mods. It's the only way to be sure.

Bonus though, it's a reasonably simple example project if you want to start modifying the Bannerlord UI with ``UIExtenderEx``.

## Dependencies
* ``Bannerlord.Harmony``
* ``Bannerlord.UIExtenderEx``

## Installation & Load Order
Build and install manually. Nexus/Vortex might come later, idk. ``Harmony`` comes first, then ``UIExtenderEx``, then everything else, then this.   

## For Players
Save. Press butan. Get baby. Profit.
